= RedCloth (minor modifications)

This repository was forked from jgarber/redcloth on 2013-05-02.

These are the changes so far:
* Do not handle single quotes <code>'</code> as blocks. This caused some parsing problems (SRC#298)

= Use

1. Add <code>gem "RedCloth", :git => "https://github.com/groe/redcloth"</code> to the Gemfile.

2. Compile it: <code>cd `bundle show RedCloth` && rake compile && rake install</code>
